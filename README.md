## Survival Strategies: Exploring Ministerial Replacement Across Regime Types


Welcome to the repository for my final paper in **GVPT888A**, where I delve into the intricate dynamics of **ministerial replacement** across different regime types. This project uses Google Scholar to explore the most influential works on ministerial turnover, helping to better understand how regime performance shapes ministerial duration and durability.

This repository contains all the code you need to replicate the work and dive into the literature surrounding ministerial replacement. Here's how you can get started:

1. **Scrape the most cited works on Ministerial Replacement**  
   Run `R code/01_scraping_google_scholar.R` to extract relevant articles from Google Scholar.
   
2. **Extract citation data**  
   Use `Python code/2_get_citations_from_articles.ipynb` to gather citation information from the articles.

3. **Join the data for analysis**  
   Execute `R code/3_join_data.R` to combine the datasets into a unified format.

4. **Visualize the network**  
   Finally, run `R code/4_network.R` to generate visualizations and network analyses based on the gathered data.

You can explore all the output figures and insights from this literature review in the **plots** folder. These figures will help visualize the interconnections between key works and the evolution of thought around ministerial replacement.
